/*
Here is my fairy tale economy calculator. 
As suggested, I used my small change calculator as a starting point. 
The main challenge of course is the conversion. 
I started by converting all items into scraps, 
as can be seen in the commeents behind the variables. 
Copy and pasting the values into my logic and voila. Should work. 
Does it? havent done the math in my head tbh xd

int silverCoins;//worth 3 Hardwood Blocks == 306 scraps 
int hardwoodBlocks;//worth 102 Scraps
int scraps;//worth â€¦ 1 Scrap
